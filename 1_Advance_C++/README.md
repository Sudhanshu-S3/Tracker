# Advanced C++ Plan

Focus topics:
- Memory ownership, RAII, and smart pointers
- Move semantics, rule of five, and template mastery
- Concurrency primitives and lock-free patterns
- STL internals, allocators, and compile-time tricks

Hands-on goals:
- Write a thread pool and a bounded queue
- Build a custom allocator and experiment with SFINAE guards
- Profile code paths for latency and cache behavior
