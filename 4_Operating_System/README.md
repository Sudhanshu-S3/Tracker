# Operating Systems Plan

Focus topics:
- Process vs thread, context switches, and scheduling
- Deadlock handling, semaphores, and mutex patterns
- Virtual memory, paging, segmentation, and TLB behavior
- File systems, system calls, and kernel transitions

Hands-on goal:
- Simulate a CPU scheduler in C++ and analyze behavior
