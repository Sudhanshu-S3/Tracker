## Dynamic Programming

Practice both standard and non-standard DP problems to build confidence.

### How to build intuition
- Restate the problem in your own words and list the inputs and outputs.
- Try a small brute-force recursion to see overlapping subproblems.
- Identify the state (indexes, sum, mask, etc.) and write the recurrence.
- Draw a table or graph to visualize transitions.
- Memoize first, then convert to tabulation when it feels natural.
- Test with tiny cases and edge cases to check the state choices.

> Note: I will try to implement both Memoized and Tabulation Solution for every problem i practice.
