I have learned the following here:


socket(2) — man 2 socket  

ip(7) — man 7 ip  

etc.


Commands to view and read manual pages in Linux.


I learned about RFC (Request for Comments).


RFCs contain protocols for making proper connections on the Internet. RFCs are defined by standards organizations such as the IETF.


In the Sockets directory I have documented what I learned and tried to build a small implementation project to solidify my understanding.


In sockets I learned about:

socket(2), bind(2), ip(7), accept(2), read(2)


Steps to implement a server:

1. Create a socket
2. Bind the socket to an address and port
3. Perform operations (listen, accept, communicate)
4. Send the response through the connection


More details are in the theory.md file in the Sockets directory.
