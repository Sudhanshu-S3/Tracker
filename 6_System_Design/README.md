# My System Design Playbook

This repository is my personal reference guide for breaking down and understanding System Design. The goal is to create a reference resource for preparing for technical interviews that involve designing large-scale systems.

## Theory - Core Concepts

This section covers the fundamental building blocks of any distributed system & design patterns. Think of these as the "Lego bricks" you can use to build anything.

Example Topics include:
* **Load Balancing**
* **Caching Strategies**
* **Database Scaling** (Sharding, Replication)
* **Message Queues**
* **Other**

## Case_Studies

This is where we put the concepts into practice. This section contains step-by-step breakdowns of how to design popular, real-world applications. Each case study follows a structured approach to tackle the problem, from gathering requirements to identifying bottlenecks.

Examples include:
* **Design a Instagram (Social Media Feed)**
* **Design a URL Shortener**
* **Design a Trading System**
* **Design a Ride-Sharing App (like Uber)**
* **Design a LeetCode Like application**
* **Design a Video Streaming Platform**
* **Design a AI Interview prep Platform**
* **Other**

Note: All case studies have an HLD and LLD part.

## System Design Plan

Low-level (C++):
- Thread pools, rate limiters, and in-memory stores
- Interface design, abstractions, and concurrency control

High-level:
- URL shortener, chat, logging, and caching systems
- Sharding, replication, load balancing, and CAP trade-offs
- Monitoring metrics and API design for the backtester

This project is a work in progress. My aim is to build a clear and simple guide for tackling any system design question with confidence.
