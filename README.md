# Learning Tracker

This repository keeps my prep for low-latency C++ developer and SDE roles organized.  
Each folder has a focused README with topics, practice goals, and hands-on tasks.

## Structure
- `Advance_C++` – modern C++ mastery, performance, and concurrency
- `DSA` – core algorithms, patterns, and coding drills
- `System_Design` – low-level and high-level design scenarios
- `Operating_System`, `Computer_Networks`, `Database` – fundamentals for interviews
- `Quant_Finance`, `Machine_Learning` – domain skills for trading and ML projects
- `Projects` – practical builds to apply concepts

## How I use it
1. Pick a folder and follow the plan in its README.  
2. Track progress with notes, code samples, and benchmarks.  
3. Update plans as I gain insight or identify gaps.

Stay consistent, measure improvements, and keep latency-focused thinking at the core.
